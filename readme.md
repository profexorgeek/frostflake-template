# FrostFlake game template

This is a template project to make it easy to get started with the [FrostFlake game engine](https://github.com/profexorgeek/frostflake).

This repo includes a basic webpack configuration, **project.json** and some custom `View`s that show how to use the engine.

To get started:

1. Fork this repo
1. Run: `npm install` to fetch FrostFlake and webpack dependencies
1. Run: `npm run build` to watch for file changes and rebuild
1. Run: `npm start` to start `http-server` and run the game at `http://localhost:8080`
1. Browse the **src** folder to see demos of how the engine works
