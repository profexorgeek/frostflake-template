# FrostFlake game template

This is a template project to make it easy to get started with the
[FrostFlake game engine](https://github.com/profexorgeek/frostflake).

This repo includes a basic webpack configuration, **project.json** and
some custom `View`s that show how to use the engine.

The general idea is to fork this repo to get an easy starting point,
and use that as the basis of your game.

## Basic: Build with NPM dependency

You will need to have Node installed and a basic understanding of how to run
Node commands in a terminal. Follow these steps to start a new game with
the [FrostFlake game engine](https://github.com/profexorgeek/frostflake):
